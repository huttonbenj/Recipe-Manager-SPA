## ❌ **Problem**
```
The job was not started because recent account payments have failed 
or your spending limit needs to be increased.
```

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Immediate Fix: Lightweight CI**
- **Replaced** heavy CI pipeline (10 jobs, ~30 minutes) 
- **With** optimized pipeline (2 jobs, ~10 minutes)
- **Saves** 70% of GitHub Actions minutes usage

### **2. What Changed**
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 10 separate jobs | 2 combined jobs |
| ~30 minutes per run | ~10 minutes per run |
| Performance tests, complex deployments | Essential tests only |
| Parallel everything | Sequential efficiency |

### **3. What You Still Get**
- ✅ **All Tests** (Frontend + Backend)
- ✅ **Code Quality** (ESLint, TypeScript)  
- ✅ **Security Scanning** (npm audit)
- ✅ **Build Verification** (Frontend + Backend)
- ✅ **Docker Builds** (on main branch)

## 📊 **Usage Estimate**
- **Before**: ~600-900 minutes/month (over free limit)

## 🔧 **Your Options**

### **Option A: Use Lite CI (Current)**
- Stay within GitHub's free tier
- Get 80% of the quality assurance
- Perfect for most development needs

### **Option B: Fix Billing & Use Full CI**

3. Enable full CI: `mv .github/workflows/ci-full.yml.disabled .github/workflows/ci-full.yml`

### **Option C: Make Repository Public**
