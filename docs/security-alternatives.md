# Security Scanning for Personal GitHub Accounts

## Why CodeQL Doesn't Work for Personal Repos

GitHub's CodeQL code scanning is a premium feature that requires:
- **Public repositories** (free), OR
- **Private repositories** with GitHub Pro ($4/month), Team, or Enterprise accounts

For personal accounts with private repositories, CodeQL will fail with:
```
Error: Code scanning is not enabled for this repository
```

## Our Alternative Security Solution

We've implemented a comprehensive security scanning pipeline that provides excellent coverage:

### 1. **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning**
```bash
npm audit --audit-level=high
```
- Checks all dependencies for known security vulnerabilities
- Fails the build on high-severity issues
- Free and works for all repository types

### 2. **Static Code Analysis**
```bash
npm run lint --workspace=apps/frontend
npm run lint --workspace=apps/backend
```
- Uses ESLint with security-focused rules
- Catches common security patterns and issues
- Analyzes TypeScript/JavaScript for vulnerabilities

### 3. **Sensitive File Detection**
```bash
# Checks for accidentally committed secrets
find . -name "*.pem" -o -name "*.key" -o -name "*.p12" -o -name "*.pfx"
find . -name ".env" -not -path "./node_modules/*"
```
- Prevents accidental commit of private keys
- Detects environment files that should be gitignored
- Fails build if sensitive files are found

### 4. **Hardcoded Secret Detection**
```bash
# Searches for potential API keys, passwords, tokens
grep -r -E "(password|secret|key|token|api_key).*=.*['\"][^'\"]{10,}"
```
- Scans source code for hardcoded credentials
- Warns about potential security risks
- Helps maintain security best practices

## Implementation in CI/CD

Our security scanning runs in the GitHub Actions pipeline:

```yaml
security:
  name: Security Scan
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Run npm audit
      run: npm audit --audit-level=high
    
    - name: Run ESLint Security Analysis
      run: |
        npm run lint --workspace=apps/frontend
        npm run lint --workspace=apps/backend
    
    - name: Check for sensitive files
      run: [custom script]
    
    - name: Check for hardcoded secrets
      run: [custom script]
```

## Results and Monitoring

- **GitHub Actions Logs**: View detailed security scan results
- **Pull Request Checks**: Automatic security validation on PRs
- **Build Failures**: Pipeline fails on security issues
- **Notifications**: Email alerts on failed security scans

## Next Steps

1. **Current Setup**: Our alternative provides solid security coverage
2. **For Production**: Consider upgrading to GitHub Pro for CodeQL
3. **Open Source**: Make repository public for free CodeQL access
4. **Third-party Tools**: Integrate Snyk or SonarCloud for enhanced scanning

## Conclusion

While CodeQL is excellent, our alternative security scanning provides:
- ✅ **Comprehensive coverage** for common vulnerabilities
- ✅ **Zero cost** for personal accounts
- ✅ **Easy maintenance** with standard tools
- ✅ **CI/CD integration** with clear results

This approach ensures your Recipe Manager SPA maintains high security standards regardless of your GitHub account type.
